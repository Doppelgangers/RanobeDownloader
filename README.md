## Usage

After installing and running the program, I recommend changing the path for saving audiobooks. To do this, instead of the URL, enter the "settings" command, select item 2 and specify the path where folders with audiobooks will be saved, for example "C:\Users\root\Desktop\".

Enter 0 to exit settings.

To download an audiobook, select a book on the site (https://akniga.org/), and copy its link and paste it into the program, for example "https://akniga.org/dik-filip-otec-dvoynik-1".

Press Enter and wait for the download to complete.
